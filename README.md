# Tang-Aircraft
Project Introduction:
The second solution of rigid rotor VTOL aircraft. Foldable rotors on the top and bottom of the body.
The greatest distance between the upper and lower rotors, circle flight, helps rotor lift balance.
Tandem fixed wing, 2 motors on the fixed wing to tilt the fuselage as a whole, instead of a tilting disk.
Uncrowned political prisoners invented the uncrowned patent.
Simple structure, easy operation, and high performance with low cost.
Large lift-to-weight ratio.
Maybe it could bring about an industrial and lifestyle revolution.

Project Status:
Please global experts manually review: already reviewed by OPEN AI: dong090909 rigid rotor first criterion, third criterion.
Make sample and test.
